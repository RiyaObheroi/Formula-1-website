           <p> If there's one word that dominates Esteban Ocon's career, it's 'sacrifice'.
            Back when he was just a promising karter, Ocon's parents sold their house, put their jobs on hold and began a life on the road, living in a caravan and travelling from circuit to circuit to support their son's burgeoning career. 
            Though it was a sacrifice, in 2014 he got a seat as he beat the most promising diver in F3. Ever since then his career has own seen the sunlight.</p>

         <p>Michael Schumacher was the undisputed king of Formula 1 in the early 2000s, picking up wins and championships at a rate that was simply unheard of at the time. It was going to take someone very special to topple the Ferrari legend from his throne – and that it was Fernando Alonso who did it, tells you all you need to know about the Spaniard.Fiercely competitive, Alonso is not shy about his talent, rating himself as 9/10 “in everything” and filled in the shoes of Michael Schumacher perfectly.</p>
