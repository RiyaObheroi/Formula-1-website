	<i>Redbull racing is a Formula One racing team also know as Red Bull or RBR, which is currently headed by the Christian Horner who founded it in the year 2004. The team currently is racing with a Honda powered car. In the early years the team took sometime to stablize and by 2011 the team dominated the entire season with Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettal. Both the drivers dominating the season from the start, and making Vettal the youngest world champion.
	<br>
	There were green shoots of success from the beginning of the 2019 season for Max. He really shone in Austria where he took his first win of the year and Honda’s first Formula One win since 2006. Max went on to claim two more wins, his first pole position, and finish third in the Drivers’ Championship – his best season to date. After 12 races into the season, Alex Albon was promoted from Toro Rosso for the remainder of the season. Alex’s debut season was rewarded when he claimed the Rookie of the Year trophy at the end of season awards.

  The two drivers returned in 2020 along with Honda, however the season start was put on hold, along with the world, as the COVID-19 global health pandemic hit. However, the sport eventually got going in July at the Red Bull Ring and a shortened 17-race calendar was confirmed.
  It was a relatively successful campaign for the Team, despite being up against a strong Constructors' title winning Mercedes. The season was a strong one for Max, with the Dutchman claiming a podium finish in all but one of the races he finished. He ended 2020 with one pole position, two race wins, six second places and three third place finishes. Max finished third in the Drivers’ World Championship with 214 points.
  Teammate Alex had a tougher season after struggling to get on top of the tricky RB16. But he made history in Mugello by becoming the first ever Thai driver to claim a podium finish in Formula One. He followed that up with another third place in Bahrain and finished the Drivers’ World Championship in seventh with 105 points.The pair’s achievements saw the Team finish P2 in the Constructors’ Championship on 319 points.
  Entering the 2021 season, the Team will have a new driver line up with Max and Sergio ‘Checo’ Pérez going behind the wheel of our new challenger. As Alex changes roles in the Team and becomes Red Bull Racing’s Test and Reserve Driver.
	<br>
	The team is ready to start another exciting season with its two drivers Max Verstappen who has been a part of the team since 2016 and is an aspiring driver. Sergio Perez has been signed up to redbull for the 2021 season. This will be the first time Perez is will be racing for the team. Really looking forward for the new season to start!
